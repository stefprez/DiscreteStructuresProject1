Given a relation r on the set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}. You are to write one program 
to determine whether or not r is reflexive, symmetric, transitive, antisymmetric, an 
equivalence relation. In case r is an equivalence relation, you are to find and output 
the equivalence classes. In case r is not transitive, you are to determine and output the 
Boolean matrix of the transitive closure of r.

3 sample outputs might be (not actual outputs for the test matrices mentioned later)

The relation with matrix

 (output matrix here)

 is not reflexive,
 
 is not symmetric,
 
 is transitive,
 
 is antisymmetric,
 
 is not an equivalence relation
 
 
 The relation with matrix
 
 (output matrix here)

 is reflexive,
 
 is symmetric,
 
 is transitive,
 
 is not antisymmetric,
 
 is an equivalence relation with equivalence classes

 {1,5,8}, {2,4}, {3,7}, {6}
 
 
 The relation with matrix
 
 (output matrix here)

 is reflexive,
 
 is not symmetric,
 
 is not antisymmetric,
 
 is not transitive,
 
 is not an equivalence relation
 
 The matrix of its transitive closure is

 (output that matrix here)
 

The program may be written in either JAVA or C++ and should input the 8 by 8 Boolean 
matrix of r from a file. Use each of the 6 test matrices found in the file Relations.doc on 
my website http://people.emich.edu/mzeiger as an input to your program. If you wish, you can supply all 6 matrices in a single input file. In that case, there will be one output containing results for all 6 matrices. You should 
hand in a hardcopy of

a) your program (properly documented)

b) the inputs

c) the results of running the program for the 6 test cases
